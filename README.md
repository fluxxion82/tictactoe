# tictactoe
This was just a quick app I had to build for techincal interview recently. Wrote this in about two-three days. Computer should always draw or win. 

There's a lot I'd like to change to really polish the code up. I was going for a Strategy pattern, but it turned into a decorator pattern instead. I went through the Strategies based on the tic tac toe Wiki page, and so it helped me break down the different strategies, which lead to the decorator pattern since it was easier for me to understand the strategies. I'm sure you can see how it can be refactored to be more of a Strategy pattern than what I've done. It may be more work.

Some of the stuff I did was just to try and show some forethought on the framework, and the show the flexibility and extensibility of adding other board games, or games.

Again, this was just a quick exercise I did quickly, and gave me an opportunitiy to try new patterns. If you have some constructive critisim, I'm always open to hear about it.
